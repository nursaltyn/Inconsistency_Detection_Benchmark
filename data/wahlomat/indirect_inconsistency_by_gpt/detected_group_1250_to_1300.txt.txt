To detect indirect inconsistencies within the given statements, we need to analyze potentially opposing values or ideologies. Let's explore these contrasts:

1. **Economy vs. Social Welfare**:
   - The statement supporting "Private investors shall be involved in financing the expansion of traffic routes in North Rhine-Westphalia" (economic privatization) contrasts with "The state should wholly take over the debts of over-indebted municipalities" (government intervention).
   
2. **Civil Liberties vs. Public Safety**:
   - "The police in North Rhine-Westphalia should be able to carry out suspicion-independent identity checks" (focus on security at potential cost of privacy) contrasts with "The data protection rights of citizens are to be further restricted when prosecuting serious crimes" (another indication of prioritizing security over privacy).

3. **Integration vs. Restriction on Asylum Seekers**:
   - "The state should promote projects for the integration of migrants" contrasts with "Schleswig-Holstein should deport rejected asylum seekers from Afghanistan to their home country" (supports integration vs. restriction).
   
4. **Equality vs. Traditionalism in Education**:
   - "All children with and without disabilities should be taught together" contrasts with "In schoolbooks, only the traditional family image (father, mother, and children) should be conveyed" (inclusivity vs. traditional values).

5. **Environmental Policy**:
   - "No further areas for wind turbines should be designated in Saarland" contrasts with "The state should provide financial incentives for more agricultural businesses to switch to organic farming" (aversion to wind energy development vs. support for sustainable agriculture).

6. **Cultural Modernity vs. Tradition**:
   - "For silent days (e.g., Good Friday, day of national mourning), the dance ban should be maintained" contrasts with the lacking statement but implies opposition to cultural modernization trends.

Based on these analyses, here is the CSV format capturing indirect inconsistencies:
