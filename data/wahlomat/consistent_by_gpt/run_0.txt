Here are some statements from the list that indicate potential indirect inconsistencies:

1. **Bildungsurlaub** vs. **Kopfnote**: 
   - Bildungsurlaub promotes the idea of personal and professional development through continuing education, suggesting a system that values ongoing learning and skills enhancement.
   - Kopfnoten, such as behavior and diligence, suggest a traditional schooling focus on personal traits over skills, and potentially less emphasis on continuous development.
   - Translation: "Employees should have a legal claim to educational leave ('Bildungsurlaub')." vs. "Reintroduction of conduct grades (e.g., behavior, diligence) on school reports!"

2. **Gleichgeschlechtliche Partnerschaften** vs. **Traditionelles Familienbild**: 
   - Promoting equality for same-sex partnerships signals a push for inclusivity and diversity.
   - Emphasizing only the traditional family model may be seen as not recognizing diverse family structures.
   - Translation: "Registered partnerships ('Homo-Ehen') should be equal to marriage." vs. "The schoolbooks in Schleswig-Holstein should primarily convey the traditional family image (father, mother, child)."

3. **Erneuerbare Energien** vs. **Braunkohle**: 
   - Encouraging renewable energies indicates sustainability goals.
   - Extended use of lignite (Braunkohle) contradicts environmental progress.
   - Translation: "More areas for wind power plants shall be designated in Rhineland-Palatinate." vs. "In Saxony-Anhalt, electricity shall be produced permanently from lignite."

4. **Ökologische Landwirtschaft** vs. **Nutztierbegrenzung**: 
   - Promoting only ecological farming suggests prioritization of sustainable practices across all agricultural segments.
   - Limiting livestock merely balances farm size and resources, not necessarily ecological methods.
   - Translation: "Hessen should only support organic agriculture." vs. "The number of livestock should be limited in relation to the agricultural property area."

5. **Kostenloser öffentlicher Verkehr** vs. **Investition in Flughäfen**: 
   - Free public transportation in urban areas suggests prioritizing accessible and sustainable city transit.
   - Investments in airports and commercial traffic infrastructure can potentially contradict urban sustainability efforts.
   - Translation: "Use of public transport in Berlin should be free of charge." vs. "The state should invest more in the Saarbrücken airport."

These potential inconsistencies suggest varying approaches to inclusivity, environmental policies, and public infrastructure, revealing the complexities in policy-making that might impede achieving uniform policy directions.
